\chapter{Background}
This section aims to provide some background on subjects discussed in this master thesis.  These subjects are not directly addressed in other areas of this master thesis.  Nevertheless, knowledge of them is either necessary or useful to understanding what follows.

\paragraph*{Formal Methods}
Formal methods are aimed at improving the reliability and correctness of systems\cite{formalmethodslcarke}.  In systems engineering, formal methods are most often employed in the specification and verification of systems.  But, they are not limited to this phase. phase\footnote{There is growing research in the area of applying formal methods to the implementation phase of software engineering.  See \cite{varvel} and \cite{modularC}, for example.  The author speculates that the not-to-distant future will see greater application of formal methods and automation applied towards the implementation phase of systems engineering.  ...but, that is not the topic of this master thesis.}.  

Formal methods employ the rigors of mathematics and logic to verify desired aspects of the system.  The primary tools of formal methods are theorem proving, model checking, and This master thesis applies formal methods to prove the security properties of a system. 

The appeal of formal methods is in their rigorous approach to analyzing systems.
