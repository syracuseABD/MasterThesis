\chapter{Background}
This section aims to provide some background on subjects discussed in this master thesis.  These subjects are not directly addressed in other areas of this master thesis.  Nevertheless, knowledge of them is either necessary or useful to understanding what follows.

\paragraph*{Formal Methods}
Formal methods are aimed at improving the reliability and correctness of systems\cite{formalmethodslcarke}.  In systems engineering, formal methods are applied to all phases of systems engineering\footnote{For a quick overview of formal methods check out the wikipage \cite{wikiformalmethods}}.   

Formal methods employ the rigors of mathematics and logic to verify desired aspects of a system.  Most commonly, the aspects of a system that require formal verification are correctness and security properties.  The primary tools of formal methods are theorem proving and model checking.  This master thesis focuses on the verifying security properties of a system using theorem proving.  

After a system is modeled (specified), a theorem prover can prove essential properties of the system.  For example, does the system prevent unauthorized access to a user's personal data?
