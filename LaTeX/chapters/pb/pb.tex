%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Chapter Patrol Base Operations %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Patrol Base Operations}
This is the future works section. But, as I am typing this, it is the current working section for \LaTeX\.  The point here is to get the margins in order.   This means that there must be text of sufficient length to visually verify that the text meets LORI's standards.  LORI is complying with SU standards for the senior thesis.  Therefore, meeting LORI's standards is synonymous with meeting SU's standards.  Resistance will only degrade you.
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Section Motivation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This text deals with acronyms.  This means that i'm testing where the acronym \Gls{csbd} will show-up in the main document and how it will be presented in the Acronyms section.
