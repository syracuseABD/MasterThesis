This master thesis demonstrates that \glsentryshort{csbd} is effective for verifying complete mediation on non-automated, human-centered systems.  The \glsentryshort{csbd} approach is effective, but it is not unique.  Therefore, the implication of this work is that complete mediation can be verified on non-automated, human-centered systems.
