	Abstract = {Runtime monitoring systems play an important role in system security, and verification efforts that ensure that these systems satisfy certain desirable security properties are growing in importance. One such security property is complete mediation, which requires that sensitive operations are performed by a piece of code only after the monitoring system authorizes these actions. In this paper, we describe a verification technique that is designed to check for the satisfaction of this property directly on code from Java standard libraries. We describe a tool CMV that implements this technique and automatically checks shrink-wrapped Java bytecode for the complete mediation property. Experimental results on running our tool over several thousands of lines of bytecode from the Java libraries suggest that our approach is scalable, and leads to a very significant reduction in human efforts required for system verification.},

@article{saltzerschroeder,
	Abstract = {This tutorial paper explores the mechanics of protecting computer-stored information from unauthorized use or modification. It concentrates on those architectural structures--whether hardware or software--that are necessary to support information protection. The paper develops in three main sections. Section I describes desired functions, design principles, and examples of elementary protection and authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with computers should find the first section to be reasonably accessible. Section II requires some familiarity with descriptor-based computer architecture. It examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysis of protected subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of detail in the second section may wish to skip to Section III, which reviews the state of the art and current research projects and provides suggestions for further reading.
